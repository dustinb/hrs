# HTTP Request Scheduler

Schedule, record, and notify of http based cron jobs.

# Schema

Application - Way to group jobs into something meaningful or seperate permissions
Job - Specific URL, allow same job on multiple domains i.e. development/production
Instance - Need better name but a record of one run includes success/failure status + output
